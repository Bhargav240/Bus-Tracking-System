# Bus Tracking Android App 

The college bus management app is designed for students, bus in-charges, and bus drivers, providing efficient college management and easy access to live bus locations. It is built using Android Studio with Java and XML for coding, Firebase for the database, and Google Cloud Platform for the Google Maps API.

## Key Features

### Student Features

- Account Registration
  - Students register with their college email and provide personal information like route number and bus stop name. These details are stored in the Firebase database.
  - After registration, the student receives an account verification email from Firebase. Once verified, the student can log in.

- Home Page Options
  - The home page offers four main options:
    1. Profile: Displays the student's details.
    2. Maps Activity: Shows the student's location and the live location of their assigned bus.
    3. Bus Pass: Provides access to the student's bus pass information.
    4. Logout: Allows the student to log out of the app.

### Bus In-Charge Features

- Login
  - Bus in-charges have pre-assigned login credentials stored in the Firebase database. After logging in, they gain access to specific features.

- Home Page Options
  - The home page for bus in-charges has four key options:
    1. Change Password: Allows the in-charge to update their password.
    2. Bus Live Location Access: Enables viewing the live location of any bus.
    3. Student Information: Displays all students assigned to the bus. The in-charge can also change the status of their bus passes.
    4. Logout: Allows the in-charge to log out.

### Bus Driver Features

- Login
  - Drivers receive their login credentials to access the app.

- Home Page Options
  - The home page for bus drivers has two main options:
    1. Location Sharing: Allows the driver to share their live location. When this option is enabled, the app sends the driver's latitude and longitude to the database for real-time tracking by students and in-charges. When disabled, location sharing stops.
    2. Logout: Allows the driver to log out.

## Summary

These features provide a streamlined system for college management, ensuring that students, in-charges, and drivers have the tools they need to manage and access bus-related information efficiently.
